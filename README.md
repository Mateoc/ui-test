# UI candidates test v2.0

Hi, the fe is inside rule-of-thumb folder. It was created using create react andapp so to run just install dependencies and `run npm start` ( you can also use yarn or npx if you so whish)
If I have time I will do a small node server to handle the basics but it will just have a in memory db so if you kill it, all stored info will be lost. If I dont have time and I actually remember to erease this, chances are you will never see this comment so no worries.
